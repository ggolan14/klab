        In this game, you will be asked to think of a number between 1 and 6 and keep it in your mind.
        Then you will roll a virtual die.
        You wil be asked to report if the number you rolled is the one you had in mind.
        <br></br>
        If the number you rolled <b>is</b> the one you had in mind, you <b>will</b> receive a Â£1 bonus.
        <br></br>
        if the number you rolled <b>is not</b> the one you had in mind, you <b>will not</b> recieve a bonus.

        <br></br>
        Let's try it out.
